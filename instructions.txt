-------------Javascript and ES6 From Beginer To Advanced----------

1. Introduction 
    Javascript is the most demanded programming language for the web. It improves the user experience of web pages by converting it from a static page into interactive one.
    Javascript adds behaviour to web pages.

2. Ways to write
    Internal => before body tag start script tag and write js in it for example
    <script>
        console.log('hello world')
    </script>

    External => create separate file for example index.js and add a script tag link before body end tag 
                <script src="index.js"></script>

3. JavaScript Comments
    //I am single line comment in javascript 

    /*
    i am multiline comments
    in 
    javascript
    */

4. Printing In Console
    console.log('Hello Welcome in Javascript course')

5. Values And Variables in Javascript
    There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
    var
    let                                                 // It Coments in ES6 Part
    const                                               // It comes In ES6 Part

    syntax :
    keyword variable_name = value;
    var name = "my name is tanu";

    some common rules for declaring Variables are:
        1: Naming Conventions must be in camelCase. 
            example=> var userName = "nk sharma";

        2: Names are case sensitive 
            example Name name both are different varialbles.
        
        3. Cannot use Reserved words which already taken by javascript
            example var var = "cannot use var as variable name bcoz is javascript reserved keyword "

        4. Names must begin with a letter, underscore, dollar sign, 

        5.Names cannot not begin with number

        You can declare many variables in one statement.
        Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma:
            example= var name="RK", surname="sharma", age="20";

    Important Note: We will discuss about let and const later in ES6 part on line no: 

6. Data Types in Javascrpit
    Six Data Types that Are primitives
    
    1. Undefined
        Undefined data types means declare a variable but no value. we can put value letter when we need.
        var x;
    2. String
        var name = "my name is ---";
    3. Number
        var age = 20;
    4. Booleans
        var is_available = true;    var is_available = false;
    5. NULL
        var nullvariable = null;
    6. Bigint
    7. Symbol
    8. nan
        nan or not a number is a property of global object in other words it is a varialbe in global scope. The initial Value of Nan is not a number. 
    
    Note : object and arrays are also called data types
    for check data type of a varialbe use typeOf(varialbeName);

7. Expressions And operator
    10 + 5 = > This is Called An Expression
    + is called Operator 
    10 and 5 is called Opearands

    Types Of Operators: 

    1: Assignment Operator
        assign opearor used to assign value assignment operator is = 
        for example a = 20; //in this = assign value so = is called assignment operator

    2: Arithmetic Operator
        arithmetic operator means mathematical operations for example +, -, *, / etc
        5 + 5;
        5 - 5;
        5 * 5;
        5 % 5;

    3: Comparision Operator
    4. Logical Operator
    5. String Operator
    6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
